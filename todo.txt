# WIP
- make all the scrapers meet the default schema. (only 19 errors now)

# TODO

- Uncomment type of scraper test
- eliminate should be a function basic test
- rename files, we are not getting routes, we are getting destinations
- Add a check so the destinations on routes are not duplicated.
- Eliminate Scraper fase and join it with the routes to avoid extra connections.


- incorporate again default variant
  +  {
  "name": "default_variant",
  "destinationsLink": "/Air_Nippon_destinations",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/Air_Nippon_destinations.html",
  "destinationsFile": "./test/spec/Air_Nippon_destinations.json",
  "scraper": "default_variant"
},

- use node-progress to show a bar and only display on screen the errors.
