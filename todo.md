# IMPORTANT

- I am worried about the integrity of the default values returned. Example:
  + apply the default scraper to Air_Austral, the returned value is valid but it is not in reality.
- The table_center and the table_toccolours have risk of letting city without link outside the results with the error.
- updated to lodash v4 break the code and everything.

# ISSUES

- the default scraper doesn't get the links of the cities if they don't have link.

# Engineering Tasks

- Downland all the destinations
  + make all the scrapers meet the default schema. (only 13 errors now)

# Current Taks

- check that all the IATA airports are saved into individual files.
  + we can check the number of airports at the list and how many files meet the criteria.
- save airports name and links from files into data folder
  + we can use fs.readdir to get the names and then require them.
  + Â¿How can we combine into one var all the file content of destinations?


# TODO

- rename files, we are not getting destinations, we are getting destinations
- unify get gefilename methods. 
- require all the files inside data that have the "destinations" prefix 
- add comments to all the code to explain why I am doing everything.
- eliminate should be a function basic test
- Add a check so the destinations on destinations are not duplicated.
- Eliminate Scraper fase and join it with the destinations to avoid extra connections.
- cleanup makefile for the NODE_ENV=test variable that thanks to debug package we are not using anymore.

# Next Features

# Publish

- incorporate badges when publish
- contribute guide
- travis

# Naming

- airlinedata.io
- airdata.io
- aviationdata.io

# Notes:

- A good way to set the defaults for test would be `var BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? "local..." : "wikipedia";`
